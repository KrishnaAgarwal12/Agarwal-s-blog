  <h2>MY PASSIONATE WORLD</h2>
  <p>Welcome to the passionate world of Krishna Agarwal,

I was born on June 9, 2009, and I have a wide range of interests and skills. I'm kind of introvert and i have social anxiety. I'm working on it. 

I love football and Formula 1, and I watch both avidly. I also play chess and am learning to play the guitar, adding music to my creative pursuits. 

Iâ€™m very active in sports and play football, basketball, cricket, badminton, volleyball, and throwball. This variety shows my passion for physical activity and teamwork.Swimming is another skill Iâ€™ve mastered because I enjoy staying active.

On the creative side I write songs, poems, poetry and all the stuffs. I also produce hip-hop beats sometimes pop too. I'm in deep deep love with music can't pass a single day without it. I'm addicted to music. I'm currently learning to play guitar too. 

Painting is one of my biggest passionsâ€”I enjoy working with different styles like water, oil, canvas, poster, and fabric painting. Alongside my artistic interests, Iâ€™m practical and curious, often building things and exploring computers.

I keep a journal where I write regularly, reflecting on my thoughts, experiences, and creative ideas. This habit helps me stay focused and disciplined.

Currently, Iâ€™m studying commerce and am dedicated to following my dream of becoming powerful and influential in the business world. I have idols who inspire me to work hard and stay committed.

I balance my hobbies and studies by maintaining a disciplined routineâ€”studying late into the night and taking peaceful early-morning walks while listening to music to stay focused. My diverse talents and dedication make me a well-rounded and passionate individual.

It's my first blog if it's wrong please forgive me 

Thank you
Peace ðŸ•Š out</p>
